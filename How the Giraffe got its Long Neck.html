    <h2>How the Giraffe got its Long Neck</h2>
<p>Many moons ago, there was a beautiful land where all was calm and pleasant. Where the gods, perched tediously on their clouds above, looked down upon the perfect animals and conferred with each other and decided that all was good.

However, one ignorant beast changed all this: one day Giraffe woke up from his quiet slumber feeling unusually like it was his duty to irritate everyone in the perfect land.

Firstly, he went to Hippo.
“Why are you so purple? Did you pick a fight with someone bigger than yourself?” Giraffe taunted. Giraffe felt a strange happiness when he was nasty, so he decided to do it some more. He strolled casually up to Snake.
“Why do you wriggle on your belly?” he mocked. “Did someone take your feet away?”


This horrible way of talking to people had quite pleased Giraffe and he became progressively worse throughout the week. The other animals had had quite enough, so they went to the gods.
“Our hearts are filled with sorrow; Giraffe is always nasty to us. Please teach him a lesson,” the animals begged the gods.
“We’ll see what we can do,” replied the gods.

<p>One night, when Giraffe was asleep, Rock god had a plan. He found lots of heavy rocks and sidled up to Giraffe.
Rock god placed the rocks carefully around Giraffe’s short neck. Rock god then went back to his place in the clouds, chuckling as he went.

When Giraffe awoke and found his neck trapped in between some rocks, he was in a frightful rage. He tugged as hard as he could but he couldn’t move, his neck merely grew longer and longer.

Finally, after lots of tugging, Giraffe was free. He was astonished to see his beautiful neck was ugly and long. 
And so, to this day, giraffes have always had long necks to remind them not to say horrible things.
