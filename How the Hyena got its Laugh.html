            <h2>How the Hyena got its Laugh</h2>
<p>One day, there was a hyena called Alfie, he lived in the graaslands of Africa where Leom the cheetah also lived. 

One day, Leom passed Alfie and then they stopped, <br>if you think they're going to ambush each other, 
then your wrong. Actually Leom told Alfie a joke. 
<br><b>"Why did the kudu cross the road?"</b>
"To get eaten by a crocodile". 
"Yes". 

<br>Throughout the day Leom kept telling Alfie loads of jokes. 
And guess what, Alfie couldn't hold it in. So he laughed, Ha!, Ha!, Ha!, Ha! That's so funny.
 So that's how hyenas got their laugh.</p>
