    <h2>The Elephant Got Its Trunk</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a herd of elephants. All of the elephants didn’t have trunks because it wasn’t invented yet so they looked liked pigs, but I will tell you how the elephants got their trunks.

One day a baby elephant was taking a stroll to get some water from the river and while he was drinking a crocodile came up and took the elephant by the neck and threw him in the water (crunch crunch crunch). <p> Five seconds later blood was rising from the river. This happened a lot to baby elephants when they were taking drinks from crocodile infested waters in the african grasslands, and it had to be stopped!

Then one day an adult elephant came, it also came to get a drink. Then a crocodile rose up from the muddy water and grabbed its nose and pulled and pulled then suddenly the crocodile let go of the elephants nose.<p> The elephant fell back and realized his trunk was 3m long! Very quickly he ran back to the elephant herd and said. Hey guys look - having a long nose is awesome because you can lift stuff and drink water from it, it's awesome! 

All the others got the treatment too and that’s how the elephant got its trunk! But some elephants got their trunk's bitten off! This procedure evolved elephants so they don't look like pigs. 

Thats how the elephants got their trunk!

The End! </p>
