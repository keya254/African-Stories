    <h2>How the Elephant got his big ears</h2>
<p>In a grassland in the continent of Africa there was an elephant and a zebra. And they were in the savannah.

The elephant was talking to the zebra but the elephant had tiny ears so he couldn’t hear what the zebra was saying, so the zebra got fed up so the zebra got the elephant’s ears and he pulled it and twisted it and the zebra pulled his ear again.

And that is how the elephant got his big ears</p>
