                <h2>How Rabbit got his long ears</h2>
                <p>A long time ago when Rabbit was first on this earth he had very short ears. One day he had nothing to do. He was very bored so he decided to play a trick on all the other animal's.
                He told Beaver, "Did you know that the sun was not going to rise again?"
                                 Of course Beaver told Squirrel and Squirrel told Chipmunk and Chipmunk told Skunk and so on. The story soon got around and all the animals were worried.
                                The animals were all upset. They said, "If the sun is not going to shine anymore it will be dark and cold like winter. We will have to gather our food and get ready right now."

                                 Even Bear was worried. He began to eat and eat the blueberries around him so he could grow fat and store his food. Squirrel was busy gathering all the nuts he could find. Everyone was busy getting ready for the sun not to shine again. They had no time to play even though it was a nice summer day.

                                 Now Rabbit really thought this was funny. He hide in the bushes. He was laughing and laughing as he watched the other animals all running around trying to get ready for the sun not to shine anymore.
                </p>

                <p>Along came Glooscap. Normally the animals were all very glad to see Glooscap. <p> They usually gathered around to talk to him. But this day no one run up to greet him.
                                  Glooscap asked Bear, "How are you? How is everything going?"
                                  Bear said, "I don't have time to talk to you."</p>

                <p>Glooscap just kept walking. No one paid any attention to him.
                                 Glooscap went back to Bear.
                                "What's wrong with you? You're not talking to me. What is going on? Talk to me. Something is wrong!" Glooscap said.

                                "Well, don't you know?" Bear said. "The sun is not going to shine anymore and we have to hurry up. I have to get ready for winter now. That is what everyone is doing."
                                </p>

                <p>Glooscap told bear, "Whoever told you that story is lying. It's not true."
                                   So Glooscap called a meeting with all the animals and they all gathered around him in a circle. He got to the bottom of it.
                                   He said, "Who told you Bear?"
                                   Bear said, "Raccoon told me."
                                   And Raccoon said, "Well, Chipmunk told me."
                                  Everyone said who they heard the story from, all the way down to Beaver.</p>

          
                <p>Everyone said who they heard the story from, all the way down to Beaver.
                                   Beaver said, "It was Rabbit that told me."
                                   Glooscap said, "Well, where is Rabbit?"
                                   Rabbit was really scared so he hid in the bushes. Glooscap knew for sure then that Rabbit had started the story.
                                   "Where is Rabbit?" he asked again.
                                    "Not here. He is gone. He must be hiding," Beaver said.
                                     Glooscap went and looked in the bushes. He found Rabbit and when he did he grabbed him by his ears and lifted him up. That is how Rabbit got his long ears.

                <h2>How Cheetah got its spots</h2>
                <p>A long, long time ago when animals could still talk, there lived a cheetah. He was the only one from his species that survived. This cheetah had a beautiful gold skin and was very quick; therefore the other animals called him Blitz. </p>

                <p>His prey could not easily escape him, and he could always find lots of wild animals, like rabbits, springbok, and hares. So, whenever he was hungry, he would go down to the river and he would always find something close by to eat. </p>

                <p>One day Blitz was down by the river, getting ready to pounce on a springbok for lunch. But when he looked up, he saw a hunter's rifle pointed at him. Blitz became frightened and he ran and ran as fast as he could. Running was something that Blitz was very good at, so good in fact, that after a few minutes, he realized that he had run far away from home. Now he was in a strange place where nothing looked familiar and food was scarce and he was getting very hungry now. 

                                Fortunately, Blitz came across a hare, and just as he was about to eat him, the hare begged him not to, promising Blitz that there were many hares nearby much fatter than he..</p>

                <p>Blitz grimaced suspiciously and told the hare to speak quickly if he wanted to live. 

With that the hare walked over to a big, dangerous-looking rock and told the cheetah that he must strike the rock as hard as he could with two stones that the hare gave him. And so Blitz took the stones and hit the strange looking rock with all of his might. 

Well, it turned out that this big rock was actually a beehive and the next moment Blitz was being tackled by a swarm of bees. Blitz ran as quickly as he could to the nearest river and jumped into the water. Meanwhile, the hare ran in the other direction and managed to escape. 

When Blitz got out of the water, he was covered in spots from all of the bee stings that he had received. The other animals asked him, "What happened to your beautiful gold skin?" He would just look angrily at them and walk by. In time though, he began to like his spots and he became proud of them because they made him look different from all of the other cats. But form that day forward, Blitz and the hare were bitter enemies.</p>

                <h2>How the Elephant got his big ears</h2>
                <p>In a grassland in the continent of Africa there was an elephant and a zebra. And they were in the savannah.

The elephant was talking to the zebra but the elephant had tiny ears so he couldn’t hear what the zebra was saying, so the zebra got fed up so the zebra got the elephant’s ears and he pulled it and twisted it and the zebra pulled his ear again.

And that is how the elephant got his big ears</p>

                <h2>How the Giraffe got its Long Neck</h2>
                <p>Many moons ago, there was a beautiful land where all was calm and pleasant. Where the gods, perched tediously on their clouds above, looked down upon the perfect animals and conferred with each other and decided that all was good.

                                However, one ignorant beast changed all this: one day Giraffe woke up from his quiet slumber feeling unusually like it was his duty to irritate everyone in the perfect land.</p>

                <p>Firstly, he went to Hippo.
                                “Why are you so purple? Did you pick a fight with someone bigger than yourself?” Giraffe taunted. Giraffe felt a strange happiness when he was nasty, so he decided to do it some more. He strolled casually up to Snake.
                                 “Why do you wriggle on your belly?” he mocked. “Did someone take your feet away?”</p>
        
                <p>
                                This horrible way of talking to people had quite pleased Giraffe and he became progressively worse throughout the week. The other animals had had quite enough, so they went to the gods.</p>

                <p>“Our hearts are filled with sorrow; Giraffe is always nasty to us. Please teach him a lesson,” the animals begged the gods.
                                “We’ll see what we can do,” replied the gods.</p>

                <p>One night, when Giraffe was asleep, Rock god had a plan. He found lots of heavy rocks and sidled up to Giraffe.
                                Rock god placed the rocks carefully around Giraffe’s short neck. Rock god then went back to his place in the clouds, chuckling as he went.

                                 When Giraffe awoke and found his neck trapped in between some rocks, he was in a frightful rage. He tugged as hard as he could but he couldn’t move, his neck merely grew longer and longer.

                               Finally, after lots of tugging, Giraffe was free. He was astonished to see his beautiful neck was ugly and long. 
                                And so, to this day, giraffes have always had long necks to remind them not to say horrible things.</p>

                <h2>How the Hyena got its Laugh</h2>
                <p>One day, there was a hyena called Alfie, he lived in the graaslands of Africa where Leom the cheetah also lived.</p>

                <p>One day, Leom passed Alfie and then they stopped, if you think they're going to ambush each other, 
                                  then your wrong. Actually Leom told Alfie a joke. 
                                  <b>"Why did the kudu cross the road?"</b>
                                   "To get eaten by a crocodile". 
                                         "Yes". </p>

                <p>Throughout the day Leom kept telling Alfie loads of jokes. 
                                  And guess what, Alfie couldn't hold it in. So he laughed, Ha!, Ha!, Ha!, Ha! That's so funny.
                                    So that's how hyenas got their laugh.</p>
